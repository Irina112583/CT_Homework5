 The task is to guess position of the robot by indirect data
 
# How to run this code
I used MathLab for implemetation of this assignment, because we worked with this tool a lot in this course, so I feel confident using it and also it is easy to draw plots there. So you can run both os scripts there to get graphs, that I also uploaded here.

## Trajectory from collected data
For the first part I just put the collected data in arrays manually and run the script and got proper result, that's why I didn't change it, and I hope, you will also find it normal. 
For getting the trajectory from the other file I used formulas, provided in attached document about Differential Drive Kinematics. As I said you also can see the results in this repository or run the code yourself.

## Kalman filter

As trajectory was non-linear KF could not be used in such case.
